#Climate Change Project Overview

Project Title: Climate Change Impact Analysis

Overview

This project aims to analyze the impact of climate change on various countries by examining key indicators such as average temperature, CO2 emissions, sea level rise, and more. The dataset used for this analysis includes comprehensive information about each country's climate-related metrics.

Dataset Features
The dataset contains the following columns:

Year: The year of observation (int64).
Country: The name of the country (object).
Avg Temperature (Â°C): Average annual temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (float64).
CO2 Emissions (Tons/Capita): Carbon dioxide emissions per capita measured in tons (float64).
Sea Level Rise (mm): The rise in sea level measured in millimeters (float64).
Rainfall (mm): Total annual rainfall measured in millimeters (int64).
Population: The total population of the country (int64).
Renewable Energy (%): Percentage of energy derived from renewable sources (float64).
Extreme Weather Events: Number of extreme weather events recorded (int64).
Forest Area (%): Percentage of land covered by forests (float64).
Objectives
Analyze Trends: Identify trends in temperature, CO2 emissions, and other climate metrics over the years.
Impact Assessment: Assess the correlation between climate change indicators and extreme weather events.
Policy Recommendations: Provide insights for policymakers on the importance of renewable energy and forest conservation.
Technologies Used
Databricks(Python and SQL), PowerBI for interactive visualizations and Calculations(DAX)
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
Git for version control
